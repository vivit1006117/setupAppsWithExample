    <div class="text">Lazy loading speeds up application load time by splitting the application into multiple bundles and loading them on demand. For example, dependencies can be lazy-loaded as needed as opposed to "eager-loaded" modules that are required by the root module, and are thus loaded on launch. Similarly, the router can load child views only when the parent view is activated, and you can build custom elements that can be loaded into an Angular app when needed.</div>
